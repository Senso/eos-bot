== Blurb ==

This bot logs you in EoS, goes through all your stores and orders a set amount of units for each out of stock item, only from the Import Market. It them assigns a price and out them on sale.

It's not an intelligent bot, it will set the price to aout 1% less than the average price (which can end up higher than average price because the game displays shortened average prices (ex. 15 k instead of 15,029)). If the cost is higher than the average price, it will put the price at 5% higher than cost.

I have not tested it a lot but it works for me. So usual disclaimer, be careful, etc. Report to me all errors you can find.

If you have suggestions or if you know a way to improve the formulas, etc. Just let me know: I'm Senso on SA and IRC. 

== Requirements ==
- Python 2.6 or higher [http://python.org]
- BeautifulSoup module for Python [http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/]

I have only tested it on Linux but in theory it should working the same way on MacOS and Windows.

== Making it work ==

You need to edit config.txt (in JSON format, but easily readable). Put your account name and passwords in the required fields, that's easy. No, I'm not stealing your credentials - look at the code.

Other values you will need to change:
- "stores": Has to be edited with your own store IDs.
- "buy_qty": This is how many items will be bought every time. It defaults to 1 for safety, if you're rich you can set it higher.

=== How to find my Store IDs ===
- Go to http://www.ratjoy.com/eos/stores.php
- Right-click on each store and choose "Copy link address" (or something similar).
- Paste into notepad or whatever.
- The store ID is the number after "fsid=".
