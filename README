This bot logs you in EoS, goes through all your stores and orders a set amount of units for each out of stock item, only from the Import Market. It then assigns a price and out them on sale.

It's not an intelligent bot, it will set the price to about 1% less than the average world price (which can end up higher than average price because the game displays shortened average prices (ex. 15 k instead of 15,029)). If the cost is higher than the average price, it will put the price at 5% higher than cost.

I have not tested it a lot but it works for me. So usual the disclaimer, be careful, etc. Report to me all errors you can find.

If you have suggestions or if you know a way to improve the formulas, etc. Just let me know: I'm Senso on SA and IRC. 

== Requirements ==
- Python 2.6 or higher [http://python.org]

I have only tested it on Linux but in theory it should working the same way on MacOS and Windows.

== Making it work ==

You need to edit config.txt (in JSON format, but easily readable). Put your account name and passwords in the required fields, that's easy. No, I'm not stealing your credentials - look at the code.

The top of config.txt should look something like that:
{
	"username": "Derpy McDerp",
	"password": "blade69",
	
	"buy_qty": 50,
	
	"stores": [
		"1234",
		"5678",
		"1827"
	],

Other values you will need to change:
- "stores": Has to be edited with your own store IDs.
- "buy_qty": This is how many items will be bought every time. It defaults to 1 for safety, if you're rich you can set it higher.

== RUN IT ==
On Linux: python new_bot_eos.py

On Windows: Double-click on new_bot_eos.py or, if you don't have Python installed, try: new_bot_eos.exe
I have just released the Windows "version" and it has not been fully tested so it possibly does not work.

== Disclaimer ==

I find all the needed info by scraping the website, which means if Ratan changes variable names or the appearance of the website, it will most likely break everything. I will try to do my best to keep it updated.
Also, if a lot of people start using it, Ratan might decide to ban players automating this part of the game, etc.
So I am not responsible for any abuse or baninations (other than my own) generated by the use of this script. 

=== How to find my Store IDs ===
- Go to http://www.ratjoy.com/eos/stores.php
- Right-click on each store and choose "Copy link address" (or something similar).
- Paste into notepad or whatever.
- The store ID is the number after "fsid=".
